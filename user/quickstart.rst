0. Try the Demo
---------------

Before installing we recommend taking a look at
:doc:`the OpenWISP Demo system <../tutorials/demo>`
to get a quick overview.

.. _install_server:

1. Install the OpenWISP server application
------------------------------------------

If you want to find out how to deploy OpenWISP for production usage,
follow the step by step `ansible-openwisp2 tutorial
<https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-openwisp2#usage-tutorial>`_.

Alternatively, there's also
`docker-openwisp <https://github.com/openwisp/docker-openwisp>`_
(in alpha stage) which
can be especially useful for testing purposes.

For testing purposes
`vagrant-openwisp2 <https://github.com/openwisp/vagrant-openwisp2>`_
can be used as well.

2. Install openwisp-config on your devices
------------------------------------------

Here's a guide on :doc:`how to install openwisp-config on OpenWRT
and connect it to OpenWISP <./configure-device>`.

If you don't have a physical OpenWRT-compatible device at hand, you can
install OpenWRT in a VirtualBox VM, that's also covered by the guide.

3. Install openwisp-monitoring on your devices
----------------------------------------------

If you want to take advantage of the features
offered by the monitoring module of OpenWISP,
read the :doc:`Monitoring Quickstart Guide <./monitoring>`.

4. Watch video demonstrations
-----------------------------
